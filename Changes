        Now using GetOptions directly to ensure module still works when
        Mojolicious::Command module changes

0.05    2012-09-16
        Added support for the --skip-lib option to not list modules
        in the ./lib directory (unless missing)

0.04    2012-09-14
        Discovered Mojolicious::Command::_options() method did not
        exist until v3.16, so changed Mojolicious requirement to
        3.16 or higher

0.03    2012-09-13
        Added requirement of Mojolicious >= 3.0 which is when the
        Mojolicious::Command namespace started        

0.02    2012-09-13
        Changed option parsing to match documentation so --include-tests
        works.

        Initial release to CPAN
